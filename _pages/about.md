I am a dedicated and motivated student. Through my studies at Sharif University of Technology, I gained deep knowledge of digital systems and mathematical tools. I enjoy working on problems that need both solid theory and a good understanding of systems. My goal is to take part in creative and high-impact research that helps improve intelligent signal processing methods.
