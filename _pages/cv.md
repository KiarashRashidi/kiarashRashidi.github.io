**Parto Tamase Novin (Parman)**  
*Product Development Engineer*  
Fall 2022 – Present  
10-Gig Ethernet Tester Prototype:In conjunction with the Data Networks Research Group at Sharif University, and under the guidance of Dr. Hadi and Dr. Pakravan, I actively participated in a collaborative endeavor as part of a two-member team. Our focus centered on the creation of a prototype for a 10-Gigabit Ethernet tester boasting eight 10-Gig SFP+ ports.
This sophisticated tester exhibits the capability to generate packets equipped with configuration layer 2 headers and payload. It goes beyond mere packet generation, providing comprehensive and accurate reports on the status of both the transmitter and receiver. Furthermore, the tester is equipped with robust event-logging functionality.
Internship Supervisor: As an internship supervisor, I provided real-world industrial problems for interns to solve using practical tools.
*Intern*
Successfully designed and implemented a hardware solution on Xilinx FPGA to efficiently fill SDH frames with data, particularly aimed at mitigating transmission errors in a noisy environment.

## Academic Projects

- **News Recommendation System** – *Massive Data Analytics* (Dr. Gholampoor)  
In this project, I utilized Apache Spark to address several large-scale data processing challenges, focusing on enhancing user experiences on social media platforms. First, I developed a news recommendation system that suggested users' favorite news based on their Tweets. This approach aimed to increase user engagement by delivering personalized content. Additionally, I implemented a stream processing system using the Bloom Filter and Flajolet-Martin Algorithm. This system efficiently handled real-time user activity data streams, enabling timely and accurate analysis of user behavior with minimal memory and computational overhead.
Furthermore, I conducted a distinct element analysis to estimate the number of unique users, hashtags, and tweets within the dataset. By employing domain-specific algorithms, I compared these estimations against exact values to assess their accuracy and efficiency.
- **Pipelined MIPS Implementation** – *Advanced Computer Architecture* (Dr. Movahedin)  
Successful implementation of a Pipe-lined ACA MIPS architecture as the first step of a project. Built upon this foundation by adding cache memory to the processor and optimizing various cache parameters to achieve peak performance on a given test bench. Additionally, optimized a matrix multiplication algorithm using the Intel AVX extension, resulting in significant improvements in processing efficiency.

- **FFT on GPU** – *Parallel Computing* (Dr. Hashemi)  
Effectively implemented the Cooley-Tukey algorithm on Nvidia GPU platform using the CUDA library. Employed advanced techniques, such as leveraging shared memory and utilizing different radix values at distinct stages to optimize the algorithm's processing speed. Successfully achieved significant performance improvements over traditional CPU-based algorithms, delivering outstanding results within the project's allotted time frame.

- **Sobel Filter on FPGA** – *Digital Systems* (Dr. Shabani)  
Implemented a Sobel filter on the DE2 evaluation board. Led the design and development of multiple modules, including UART, VGA adapter, and control logic, while ensuring seamless integration and compatibility with existing hardware components. With a focus on delivering superior results, meticulously tested and validated all modules to ensure optimal performance, resulting in an effective solution.

- **Li-Fi PHY Layer Implementation** – *Digital VLSI System Design* (Dr. Shabani)  
Implemented the physical layer of a Li-Fi system using the DC-Reduced Hadamard Coded Modulation technique on MATLAB and HDL platforms. Synthesized and verified the design on both ASIC flow and FPGA platforms. Conducted initial simulations on MATLAB and subsequently carried out the ASIC flow on Virtuoso Layout Suite.
